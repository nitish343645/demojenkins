Working at Karix Mobile for the past 5.9 years has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I have greatly enjoyed my role and am truly grateful for the opportunities that have allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. The support and encouragement from the entire team have been invaluable, and I appreciate all the learning experiences I have had.
I would like to extend special thanks to you @Nitish S Pattankar, as well as @Venkatesh Sethurama-lingam for your guidance, support, and leadership. Your mentorship has played a crucial role in my professional development, and have learned a great deal from you throughout my time here.
After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue a new direction in my career. This decision was not made lightly, but I believe it is the right time for me to take this step.
I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my notice period and am happy to assist in training my replacement or handing over my responsibilities. Please let me know how I can be of help during this time.
